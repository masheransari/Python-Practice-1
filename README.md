<b>Questions: </b>
1. Determinant D of a quadratic equation is defined as b 4ac 2 ï€­ . Write a program in python
that takes three inputs a, b, and c from the user. Then calculate Determinant D and print
it. Then find the real roots according to following three cases.
    <br/>a. If D is positive, then print the following two real roots
    <br/>b. If D is 0, then print only one real root, -b/2a
    <br/>c. If D is negative, then print "Only complex roots!"

2. Write a python function, called <b>smaller</b>, that computes the number of elements in an
array of integers x of size s that are strictly less than a given number <b>n</b>. 
<br/><b>Example</b>:
<br/>x = {13, 56, 21, 45, 20, 43, 12, 43, 6}
<br/>smaller(x, 9, 21) returns 4 (13< 21, 20 < 21, 12<21, 6<21)
<br/>smaller(x, 9, 20) returns 3 (13< 20, 12<20, 6 < 20)

3. With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program to print this list
after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.
<br/><b>Hints</b>:
<br/>Use set() to store a number of values without duplicate.

4. With two given lists [1,3,6,78,35,55] and [12,24,35,24,88,120,155], write a program to
make a list whose elements are intersection of the above given lists.
<br/><b>Hints</b>:
<br/>Use set() and "&=" to do set intersection operation

5. calculate the body mass index (BMI) of two variables input by the user:
 where:
      >BMI = weight / height (square)
 
6. Create a variable growth_multiplier, equal to 1.3. Create a variable, sales, equal to the
amount of money you earn in a years. Print out the value of sales after 7 years.

7. Now that we know how to work with numbers and strings, let's write a program that
might actually be useful! Let's say you want to find out how much you weigh in stone. A
concise program can make short work of this task. Since a stone is 14 pounds, and there
are about 2.2 pounds in a kilogram, the following formula should do the trick:
   >M(stone)=(M(kg) * 2.2)/14

8. Build the list so that the list first contains the name of each room as a string and then its
area in square meter. In other words, add the string "hall 11.3", "kitchen 6", bedroom
12.5"

9. Create a list Score that contains the GPA of a student in 6 semesters. Create 3 such
students and add them in new list call Students with the name of the student with it as
well.
